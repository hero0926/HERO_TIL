differences in kanban, agile, scrum


- agile

this refers to round hte idea, Scrum and Kanban are two of the most widely used Agile methodologies. It works by breaking projects down into little bits. make a list and size things up, set the priorities. Doing iterative and adaptive planning and development.

- scrum

the subset of agile, but lightweight. more for the focues on delivering fast. rapidly and repeatedly inspect actual working software, Agile delivers the software on a regular basis for feedback while Scrum delivers the software after each sprint. Scrum is more a self-organizing, cross-functional team.


- kanban

Kanban visualises both the process and the actual work passing through. it is for identifing potential bottelnecks, and fix them. so it is cost effectively at an optimal spped.

so basically this todo - doing - done method, following principles like start with what you are doing now, visualising the flow of work, limit work in progress, make process policies explicit, eucourage acts of leadership at all level.
