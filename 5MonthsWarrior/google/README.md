### 이메일 내용

```
기본적으로 물어보는 내용들?

lists, maps, stacks, priority queues, binary trees, graphs, bags, and sets.
You'll need to talk about how they're implemented and why you'd choose one implementation or data structure instead of another. For algorithms you'll want to know

greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, recursion, and brute force search.

You'll definitely want to be conversant with
big­O notation, time­space complexity, and real world performance of all of this.

Most importantly you'll need to be able to pick the right data structure and algorithm for a specific problem.

들어야할 인강


Algorithm / Data Structure Theory books
Google Style Guides (C++, Python, Java; Android, Javascript)
Coursera - Algorithms, Part 1
Coursera - Algorithms, Part 2
Udacity - Intro to Algorithms
MIT Open courseware - Introduction to Algorithms

기타 주의점

When you practice, do not use an IDE. You need to be able to write legible, compilable code without help with regards to layout, or spelling of standard library class/method names. I suggest solving similar style algorithmic/ DS problems on a google document or on paper to simulate a real interview. 

Practical Interview Tips
Coding fluency is prerequisite for the role, so avoid pseudo-code if you can. Your solutions will be shown to senior engineers at a later date, so need to be well-formatted & fully compilable.
Understand the importance of unit testing in Google's engineering environment
Approach a large problem by taking it apart into small pieces - the interviewer is as interested in how you approach problems as whether you reach the intended result. Don't give up on problems - maybe ask for advice.
Be passionate, the interviewer wants to know that you love coding and programming. Enthusiasm for your work, coding and computer science is important to get across.
Ask questions, showing that you are thinking about the role, the question, the problem etc.
Talk through your answer and your coding. We are looking for good programmers, but also people who can explain their thought processes and can describe, analytically what they are doing and their answers.
Don't worry if your interview is tough - engineers want to stretch you to see if you can deal with new information as well as what you know.
Listen to everything the interviewer says as he/she may be trying to give you hints or steer you in another direction.

Write down all your favourite algorithms the night before, so they are fresh in your mind.

Here are some reminders for the interview
Please be sure to use real code (don't rely on pseudocode); code should work in a compiler.
Before you begin to find your solution, take a moment to explain your  approach and how you   plan to solve the problem.
Ask clarifying questions if you don't fully understand the problem/question being asked.
Check to make sure your code works - run through at least one or two  examples to check for correctness.
Be receptive to any feedback from the interviewer.
If you can't come up with the most refined solutions right away, you can  work on the brute    force solution and improve on it - but let the interviewer know that's what you're doing.
If you're making assumptions as you reason through the problem, be sure  to communicate those assumptions to your interviewer.
