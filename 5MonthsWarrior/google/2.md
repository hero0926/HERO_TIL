lists, 
maps, 
stacks, 
priority queues, 
binary trees, 
graphs, 
bags, and
sets. 
You'll need to talk about how they're implemented and why you'd choose one implementation or data structure instead of another.
For algorithms you'll want to know

greedy algorithms,
divide and conquer,
dynamic programming,
recursion, and
brute force search.

You'll definitely want to be conversant with big­O notation,
time­space complexity, and real world performance of all of this.

Most importantly you'll need to be able to pick the right data structure and algorithm for a specific problem.
